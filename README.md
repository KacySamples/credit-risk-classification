## Objective
Comparing the two logistic regression models, one trained on the original dataset and the other on the oversampled dataset reveals how oversampling impacts the model's ability to predict high-risk loans.

## Observations
High-Risk Loan Prediction (Label 1)
Precision: Remained the same at 0.84 for both models. This indicates that the proportion of correct high-risk loan predictions out of all high-risk loan predictions made by the model did not change after oversampling.
Recall: Increased from 0.94 to 0.99. This significant improvement indicates that after oversampling, the model became better at identifying high-risk loans, correctly predicting 99% of them as opposed to 94% before. It suggests that oversampling helped the model to better learn the characteristics of high-risk loans.
F1-Score: Improved from 0.89 to 0.91. The F1-score, which balances precision and recall, increased, indicating that the model's overall accuracy in predicting high-risk loans improved with oversampling.

Healthy Loan Prediction (Label 0)
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: For healthy loans, the precision and recall remained extremely high (precision at 1.00 and recall at 0.99), and the F1-score stayed at 1.00. This indicates that the model's ability to correctly identify healthy loans was already excellent and remained consistent even after applying oversampling to address the imbalance.

Overall Model Performance
Accuracy: Remained consistent at 0.99 for both models, indicating that the overall percentage of correct predictions did not change significantly.
Macro Avg: The macro average for recall increased from 0.97 to 0.99, showing an improvement in the model's ability to correctly identify both classes. The macro average F1-score also increased from 0.94 to 0.95, reflecting a slight improvement in the balance between precision and recall across classes.
Weighted Avg: Remained consistent with precision, recall, and F1-scores staying at 0.99, indicating that the model's weighted performance across classes did not change significantly.

##Summary
The primary improvement in the logistic regression model trained with oversampled data is seen in the recall for high-risk loans (label 1), which indicates a better capability to identify nearly all high-risk loans. This improvement is crucial for applications where failing to identify a high-risk loan could have significant consequences, even if the precision did not improve. The model's ability to identify healthy loans remained strong and consistent, demonstrating that oversampling the minority class did not detrimentally affect the model's performance on the majority class. This balance is essential for maintaining overall model reliability and usefulness in practical applications.
